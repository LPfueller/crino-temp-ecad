<P>Crino offers precise characterisations of lithium ion cells for quality control in battery manufacturing and research using the crino instrument. 
Every crino instrument consists of several crino boards with actuators and sensors that are connected to a central control system (currently a Raspberry Pi). 
This control system is performing all measurements and also provides a user interface to interact with the system. 
This repository consists of Kicad development files for the board-template. 
All crino boards should be derived from this template.
